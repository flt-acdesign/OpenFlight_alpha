    convert_control_demanded_to_attained(aircraft_model_data, force_control_inputs, moment_control_inputs, deltaTime)

Computes the actually attained control inputs given the demanded controls and
an actuator speed limit. The actuator speed (in control units per second) comes
from `aircraft_model_data[:actuator_speed]`, defaulting to `1.0` if missing.

# Arguments
- `aircraft_model_data`: Dictionary containing aircraft parameters. 
   Must have `:actuator_speed` (control-units/s), or defaults to 1.0 if absent.
- `force_control_inputs`: NamedTuple with:
    - `thrust_setting_demand` :: Scalar (required)
    - `x`, `y` :: Optional force components (defaults to 0.0 if absent).
- `moment_control_inputs`: NamedTuple with:
    - `roll_demand`, `pitch_demand`, `yaw_demand` :: Demanded angles (scalars)
    - `roll_demand_attained`, `pitch_demand_attained`, `yaw_demand_attained` :: Current attained angles
- `deltaTime`: Time step (s).

# Returns
Tuple `(force_control_inputs_out, moment_control_inputs_out)` with updated attained values.
